# Overview
I wrote two different programs. One is a fibonacci program that will return the first ten number of the fibonacci sequence. The second is a simple currency conversion program that returns the conversion rates for a few countries compared to the United States. To write these programs I used typescript as the language, node.js as the compiler, and Visual Studio Code for the editor.

# Development Environment

For these progams I used a few different tools. The compiler I used was node.js. This allowed the Typescript code to be compiled and run as javascript code. I used Visual Studio Code as the editor. I also used a json file for the configuration. These programs are written in Typescript.

# Future Work

- Write the currency program to pull from a library or at least add more countries.
- Allow the user to input what country they would like to see the conversion rate for.
- Allow the user to enter number for the fibonacci sequences.
